# AngularJS Products App

## Presentation
This is a simple AngularJS application for my live coding and graduate dissertation. This project is a Full-stack Javascript and have to explain how works AngularJS with NodeJS.

**NOTE : You should open at least 3 Command Prompt**

## Pre-requisites
- Download my [NodeJS Mock WebService](https://github.com/MISTERSOFT/nodejs-mock-webservice) and follow the pre-requisites on the page
- Run the WebService (see [Annexes](https://github.com/MISTERSOFT/angularjs-products-app#run-the-nodejs-mock-webservice))
- Go to the directory of the AngularJS application and then run "npm install" to install all dependencies (it might take few minutes)
- Run the application with a web server (Ex: Run a web server with python - See [Annexes](https://github.com/MISTERSOFT/angularjs-products-app#run-a-web-server-using-python))

## Annexes
###Run a web server using Python :
- [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Check that Python is in your PATH system - You can try this command line "py --version" (with Python 3, if your are using Python 2 it's "python --version") to test
- Go to the application directory and then run :
    - With Python 3 : "py -m http.server"
    - With Python 2 : "python -m SimpleHTTPServer"

If you want to shutdown the Python Web Server, press "Ctrl + C" and spam it !!! (Because its bullshit :()


###Run the NodeJS Mock WebService :
- Open a Command Prompt and run "node server.js"

If you want to shutdown the NodeJS Server, press "Ctrl + C".
